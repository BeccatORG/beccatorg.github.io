        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>At Beccat, we are developing an exciting RPG set in a world entirely inhabited by cats. The game takes place in the city of Beccat, a metropolis inspired by the real city of Beccar, where our shelter is located.</p>
            <p>This game is not just for entertainment; it's also a way to raise funds for our kitten shelter. Every game played helps to fund the care of the cats we rescue.</p>
            <p>The game's style is unique, with a focus on an emotional and inspiring story, where players will have to make important decisions that affect the fate of the feline characters. The narrative combines adventure and moral dilemmas as players explore the city of Beccat, face challenges, and meet endearing characters.</p>
            <p>The combat will be a mix of strategy and creativity, allowing players to choose whether they prefer to fight, solve problems peacefully, or help other characters. The choices you make will influence the course of the story, creating a personalized gameplay experience.</p>
            <p>The game will also include interactive mini-games, such as kitten rescue missions and challenges related to cat care and protection, allowing players to learn more about shelter work.</p>
            <p>We hope you enjoy this incredible adventure and that together we can help more kittens in our shelter!</p>
