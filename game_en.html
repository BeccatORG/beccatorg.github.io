            <p>At BECCAT, we are creating a revolutionary RPG set in a world inhabited solely by cats, who have forged a self-sufficient society after the destruction of the old human civilization. The game takes place in the city of Beccat, a metropolis inspired by the real Beccar, home to our shelter, where every street and business has its real-life counterpart – we already have the support of 11 local businesses!</p>
            <p>But BECCAT is much more than an epic adventure: it is an educational platform. Through interactive puzzles, players will learn to program from scratch, blending entertainment with technological education. The protagonist is a “Woman in STEM” cat, a symbol of diversity and inclusion that challenges stereotypes and empowers girls and young people to explore the world of technology. Moreover, the diverse cast of characters celebrates diversity in all its forms, representing minorities, various races, and orientations.</p>
            <p>The narrative also has a strong ecological component, showcasing how the felines have built a resilient and sustainable community in the absence of humans. Players will explore the streets of Beccat, face moral dilemmas, and make decisions that influence the destiny of this feline society—whether through strategic combat, peaceful conflict resolution, or acts of solidarity.</p>
            <p>Every game played helps raise funds for our shelter, supporting the care of rescued kittens, promoting tourism, and strengthening local businesses. Join this unique adventure and be part of the change in a world where technology, culture, and inclusion come together to transform lives!</p>
